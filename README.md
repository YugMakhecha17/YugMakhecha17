###  About Me

I'm a passionate **AI/ML/DL engineer and academic researcher** with hands-on experience in building intelligent systems, conducting impactful research, and solving real-world problems across domains like **Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Financial Forecasting**, and **Smart Cities**.

I build **robust, research-driven** solutions that bridge the gap between theory and practical application â€” from deploying deep learning pipelines to building end-to-end agentic systems integrated with local LLMs and vector databases.
