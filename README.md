## Who am I?

I’m an **AI Researcher and Software Engineer** with a strong fascination for designing and deploying **end-to-end AI systems** across **healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and enterprise SaaS**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Machine Learning Research**
- **LLM & RAG Systems**
- **Full-Stack & Cloud Engineering**
- **Explainable & Trustworthy AI**

I don’t build AI because it’s trending —  
I build it **where it actually matters**.

## My Core Focus Areas

- **Explainable AI (XAI)** — removing black-box decision making
- **LLM Systems & RAG Pipelines** — citation-backed, hallucination-resistant AI
- **AI for Regulated Domains** — healthcare, finance, governance
- **ML Infrastructure & Automation** — scalable, production-first design
- **Research → Deployment Pipelines** — models that survive the real world
